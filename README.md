## ü™Ñ Installation

```sh
yarn add react-native-click-outside
```

## üìñ Usage

First of all, you need to wrap your app with `ClickOutsideProvider` as high as possible, for example in `App.tsx`:

```tsx
import { ClickOutsideProvider } from 'react-native-click-outside';

export const App = () => (
  <ClickOutsideProvider>
    { /* rest of your app */ }
  </ClickOutsideProvider>
);
```

Then you can call `useClickOutside` hook to detect clicks outside the component. First argument is the function that will be called every time user clicks outside of this component. It returns `ref` that you need to attach to the component you want to detect clicks outside of. For example:

```tsx
import { useClickOutside } from 'react-native-click-outside';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const ref = useClickOutside<View>(() => console.log('clicked outside A'));
  return (
    <View ref={ref}>
      <Text>Test</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### iOS works fine, but Android doesn't
As stated in react-native docs, on Android

> Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.

_Source: https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#collapsable-android_

If your element is collapsable, it won't be rendered, and therefore you won't be able to detect clicks outside of it.
To prevent this, you need to add `collapsable={false}` prop to the component. For example:

```tsx
const ref = useClickOutside<View>(() => console.log('clicked outside'));
<View collapsable={false} ref={ref}>
  <Text>Test</Text>
</View>
```
